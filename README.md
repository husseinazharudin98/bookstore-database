# BookStore Database Project

## Overview
This project contains an SQL script for creating and populating a `BookStore` database. The database is designed to manage the inventory of a bookstore, including details such as book titles, authors, genres, prices, and stock levels. This project is ideal for anyone looking to understand database design basics, specifically within the context of a retail inventory system.

## Features
The SQL script includes:
- **Schema Definition**: Definition of the `BookStore` table structure with appropriate data types and constraints.
- **Data Insertion**: Sample data insertion for 15 books across various genres and authors.
- **Queries**: Two SQL queries demonstrating how to retrieve all records sorted by price and how to calculate the average price of the books.

## File Description
- `BookStore.sql`: This file contains the SQL statements necessary for creating the `BookStore` table, inserting data, and performing select queries.

## How to Use
To use this project, follow these steps:
1. Ensure you have an SQL database management system (DBMS) like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite installed on your computer.
2. Open your DBMS interface and create a new database (e.g., `CREATE DATABASE bookstore;`).
3. Run the `BookStore.sql` script in your DBMS to set up the table and populate it with data.
4. Execute the provided SQL queries within your DBMS to view results or manipulate the data further as needed.
